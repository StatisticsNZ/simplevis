# simplevis

### Overview

As of simplevis 7.0.0, all ggplot2 wrapper functions have been removed. 

Users should not rely on these, and ideally use the  [{ggblanket}](https://github.com/davidhodge931/ggblanket) package instead (or alternatively rely on version 6.3.0 (`devtools::install_version("simplevis", "6.3.0")`)).

What remains in simplevis is the leaflet wrapper functions. These may or may not be supported in the future, so use at your own risk.

### Installation

Stable version from CRAN:

`install.packages("simplevis")`

Development version from github:

`devtools::install_github("StatisticsNZ/simplevis")`
