Spatial data can include simple features (e.g. points, lines or polygons) or arrays (e.g. raster).

This article will provide examples of how to create maps of `sf` (simple feature) objects using the `simplevis` package.

Example sf objects for learning are provided: `example_sf_point` and `example_sf_polygon`. However, if you want to use your own sf objects, download a small shapefile from somewhere. For example `https://data.mfe.govt.nz/layer/53494-benthic-protection-areas-2016-report/data/`.

Shapesfiles can be read in using the `sf::st_read` function. Point vector data is often provided as a `csv`. In this situation, the data.frame can be read in using `readr::read_csv` by converting the `data.frame` to a `sf` object by identifying the `x` and `y` geometry column names and the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) epsg code that these relate to. For longs and lats, the CRS is 4326. There are multiple other CRS' available (e.g. 2193 for the `New Zealand Transverse Mercator`).

```{r, eval=F}
sf::st_read("shapefile_name.shp")

readr::read_csv("point_data.csv") %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("nztme", "nztmn"), crs = 2193)
```

The `simplevis` sf functions can plot a `sf` object with any CRS, but the CRS must be specified. An error will come up in your console if you try to plot an `sf` object that does not have a CRS specified. 

The `simplevis` sf functions are wrappers for the `ggplot2` and `leaflet` packages and therefore produce output of these. They work in similar ways.

The location of features can be plotted using `ggplot_sf`.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggplot_sf(example_sf_point)
```

For the `ggplot2` wrapper function, a boundary (e.g. administrative or coastline) can be added by adding an `sf` object to the boundary argument. A `nz` (and `nz_region`) sf object are provided to illustrate this.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggplot_sf(example_sf_point, boundary = nz)
```

You can add a title through the title argument.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggplot_sf(example_sf_point, 
          boundary = nz,
          title = "An informative title, 2021")
```

You can colour variables using the `ggplot_sf_col` function. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
pal <- c("#0D94A3", "#C4C4C7", "#AE4E51")

ggplot_sf_col(example_sf_point, col_var = trend_category, 
              pal = pal, boundary = nz)
```

For numeric variables, you have the option of colouring using a method of `quantile` or `bin`, and defaulting to `quantile`. 

The `quantile` method defaults to quartiles cut using the `quantile` algorithm. But you can customise it by providing a vector to the `col_cuts` argument from 0 to 1.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggplot_sf_col(example_sf_point, median,
              col_method = "quantile", col_cuts = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1),
              legend_digits = 2, boundary = nz)
```

The `bin` method defaults to pretty breaks cut using the `pretty` algorithm. But you can customise it by providing a vector to the `col_cuts` argument from 0 to Inf (or from -Inf to Inf if the colour variable includes negative values). 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggplot_sf_col(example_sf_point, median,
              col_method = "bin", 
              col_cuts = c(0, 0.25, 1, Inf),
              legend_digits = 2, boundary = nz)
```

Faccetting works in a similar way to the plot functions. Note only one boundary can be added in. This may not work with all use cases.

```{r}
ggplot_sf_facet(example_sf_point, facet_var = trend_category, 
                boundary = nz)
```

```{r}
ggplot_sf_col_facet(example_sf_point, trend_category, trend_category, 
                boundary = nz)
```

Polygons or line geometry types can also be used in these sf functions.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggplot_sf(example_sf_polygon)
```

As a ggplot2 object is output, you can add ggplot2 layers to the simplevis function. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
long <- 174.686565
lat <- -41.315595

wgtn <- tibble::tibble(long, lat) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = 4326)

ggplot_sf_col(example_sf_point, trend_category,
              boundary = nz) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = wgtn, size = 5, col = "red") 

```

Make a non-facetted plot for a mobile device. Note the template shiny apps provide a function to detect what device the user is on and returns a TRUE or FALSE value that you can draw on with isMobile = input$isMobile within a shiny app. 

```{r}
ggplot_sf_col(example_sf_point, trend_category,
              boundary = nz, isMobile = TRUE)
```

The leaflet functions work in a similar way to the `ggplot2` wrapper functions. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
leaflet_sf(example_sf_point)
```

Instead of a `boundary` argument, users have a `basemap` argument that defaults to "light" but has other options.

```{r}
leaflet_sf(example_sf_point, basemap = "dark")
```

There is no facetting functionality provided for leaflet.

Some of the arguments are different between the leaflet and ggplot2 wrapper functions. This is because it has been opted to preserve the underlying arguments generally, so that users can add additional layers.

Note the default popups will wrap all variable names and values from the sf object. 

```{r}
pal <- c("#0D94A3", "#C4C4C7", "#AE4E51")

leaflet_sf_col(example_sf_point, col_var = trend_category, 
              pal = pal, title = "Site trends in New Zealand, 2021")
```
